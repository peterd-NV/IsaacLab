    * Physics simulation step (if ``/app/player/playSimulations`` is True)
    * Rendering (RTX path tracing, viewport updates)
    * UI updates (widgets, windows)
    * Timeline events and callbacks
    * Extension updates
    * USD/Fabric synchronization

    When to Use:
        * **After creating a new stage**: ``create_new_stage()`` → ``update_stage()``
        * **After spawning prims**: ``cfg.func("/World/Robot", cfg)`` → ``update_stage()``

        * **Before simulation starts**: During setup phase, before ``sim.reset()``
        * **In test fixtures**: To ensure consistent state before each test

    When NOT to Use:
        * **During active simulation** (after ``sim.play()``): Can interfere with
          physics stepping and cause double-stepping or timing issues.
        * **During sensor updates**: Can reset RTX renderer state mid-cycle,
          causing incorrect sensor outputs (e.g., ``inf`` depth values).
        * **Inside physics/render callbacks**: Can cause recursion or timing issues.
        * **Inside ``sim.step()`` or ``sim.render()``**: These already perform
          app updates internally with proper safeguards.
