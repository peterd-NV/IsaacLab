class BaseFrameTransformer(SensorBase):
    """A sensor for reporting frame transforms.

    This class provides an interface for reporting the transform of one or more frames (target frames)
    with respect to another frame (source frame). The source frame is specified by the user as a prim path
    (:attr:`FrameTransformerCfg.prim_path`) and the target frames are specified by the user as a list of
    prim paths (:attr:`FrameTransformerCfg.target_frames`).

    The source frame and target frames are assumed to be rigid bodies. The transform of the target frames
    with respect to the source frame is computed by first extracting the transform of the source frame
    and target frames from the physics engine and then computing the relative transform between the two.

    Additionally, the user can specify an offset for the source frame and each target frame. This is useful
    for specifying the transform of the desired frame with respect to the body's center of mass, for instance.

    A common example of using this sensor is to track the position and orientation of the end effector of a
    robotic manipulator. In this case, the source frame would be the body corresponding to the base frame of the
    manipulator, and the target frame would be the body corresponding to the end effector. Since the end-effector is
    typically a fictitious body, the user may need to specify an offset from the end-effector to the body of the
    manipulator.
