    """A contact reporting sensor.

    The contact sensor reports the normal contact forces on a rigid body in the world frame.
    It relies on the physics engine's contact reporting API to be activated on the rigid bodies.

    To enable the contact reporter on a rigid body, please make sure to enable the
    :attr:`isaaclab.sim.spawner.RigidObjectSpawnerCfg.activate_contact_sensors` on your
    asset spawner configuration. This will enable the contact reporter on all the rigid bodies
    in the asset.

    The sensor can be configured to report the contact forces on a set of bodies with a given
    filter pattern using the :attr:`ContactSensorCfg.filter_prim_paths_expr`. This is useful
    when you want to report the contact forces between the sensor bodies and a specific set of
    bodies in the scene. The data can be accessed using the :attr:`ContactSensorData.force_matrix_w`.

    The reporting of the filtered contact forces is only possible as one-to-many. This means that only one
    sensor body in an environment can be filtered against multiple bodies in that environment. If you need to
    filter multiple sensor bodies against multiple bodies, you need to create separate sensors for each sensor
    body.

    As an example, suppose you want to report the contact forces for all the feet of a robot against an object
    exclusively. In that case, setting the :attr:`ContactSensorCfg.prim_path` and
    :attr:`ContactSensorCfg.filter_prim_paths_expr` with ``{ENV_REGEX_NS}/Robot/.*_FOOT`` and ``{ENV_REGEX_NS}/Object``
    respectively will not work. Instead, you need to create a separate sensor for each foot and filter
    it against the object.
