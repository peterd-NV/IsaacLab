class DeformableObject(AssetBase):
    """A deformable object asset class.

    Deformable objects are assets that can be deformed in the simulation. They are typically used for
    soft bodies, such as stuffed animals and food items.

    Unlike rigid object assets, deformable objects have a more complex structure and require additional
    handling for simulation. The simulation of deformable objects follows a finite element approach, where
    the object is discretized into a mesh of nodes and elements. The nodes are connected by elements, which
    define the material properties of the object. The nodes can be moved and deformed, and the elements
    respond to these changes.

    The state of a deformable object comprises of its nodal positions and velocities, and not the object's root
    position and orientation. The nodal positions and velocities are in the simulation frame.

    Soft bodies can be `partially kinematic`_, where some nodes are driven by kinematic targets, and the rest are
    simulated. The kinematic targets are the desired positions of the nodes, and the simulation drives the nodes
    towards these targets. This is useful for partial control of the object, such as moving a stuffed animal's
    head while the rest of the body is simulated.

    .. attention::
        This class is experimental and subject to change due to changes on the underlying PhysX API on which
        it depends. We will try to maintain backward compatibility as much as possible but some changes may be
        necessary.
